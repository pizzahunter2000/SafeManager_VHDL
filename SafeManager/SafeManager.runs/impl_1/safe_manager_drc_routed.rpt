2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net main_state_counter/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin main_state_counter/led_bcd_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell main_state_counter/led_bcd_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net main_state_counter/prev_state_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin main_state_counter/ram_cond_reg_i_2/O, cell main_state_counter/ram_cond_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port status[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port status[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
